- count number of letters in each word
- count number of words with matching number of letters
- find number of words with a letter a in them
- create a key for each word
- key is a 26 space array, one for each letter of the alphabet
- key increases the count for each space for each matching letter. So ace is expressed as [1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,etc]


tests:

- creates a key that will match any two words containing exactly the same characters
- converts a list of words into a list of keys
- creates an array containing the indexes of the matching arrays, grouped together in buckets
        eg: if list is:
        [sword, shoe, words, sausage, pat, tap, worsd]
        list of keys is something like:
        [[1,0,1],[0,1,5],[1,2,1],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
        list of matches is:
        [[0,2,6],[4,5]]

        Then i can run a for loop over the array and using the original wordlist and the indexes, return
        the matching words.
